# News-viewer-
This Python project implements a basic news application with a graphical user interface using tkinter. It fetches top headlines from a news API, displays them along with images, and provides navigation options to move between news articles. Users can also read more about each article by clicking a "Read More" button, which opens the article in a web browser.
The application's core features include data retrieval, GUI creation, and user interaction with news content.
